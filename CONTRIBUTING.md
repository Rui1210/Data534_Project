# Contributing

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to Carbon Intensity in UK! This document outlines the process for contributing to the project and how we work together to make the Carbon intensity in UK better.

## Team Structure and Responsibilities

Our team is composed of three members: Yahan Cong, Rui Mao, Zheng Zhang. Each focusing on different aspects of the package development:

* Yahan Cong is responsible for developing the carbon_generation_visual() function.
* Rui Mao is tasked with the creation of the actual_and_forecast() function.
* Zheng Zhang handles the Get_CarbonStats() function.

## Working Flow Process

### Branching Strategy

* Each team member works on their own feature branch named after their name.
* Feature branches are created from the main branch and are used for the development of individual features.

### Development and Testing

* All code must adhere to the coding standards laid out in the project's README.
* Team members are encouraged to write clean, well-documented, and testable code.
* Comprehensive unit tests must be written to cover new functionality, and existing tests must pass before code is merged.

### Code Reviews and Merging

* Once a feature is complete, the team member creates a pull request to the main branch.
* Pull requests must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
* Feedback should be addressed promptly, and any necessary changes are made to the feature branch.
* After approval, the feature branch is merged into main.

### Documentation

* Along with code contributions, each team member is also responsible for documenting their function in the package's vignettes.
* Documentation must be clear, concise, and helpful to end-users.

## Communication
* Any merge conflicts should be resolved by the team members involved, seeking assistance from other team members if needed.
* Conflicts must be resolved in a manner that maintains the integrity of the existing codebase and adheres to the project's coding standards.

By following these guidelines, we maintain a collaborative environment where all team members can contribute effectively to the success of Carbon Intensity Package. We value everyone's input and appreciate the hard work put into making this package a valuable resource for analyzing carbon intensity data.
